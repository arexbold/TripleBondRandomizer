Based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX by Ajarmar

# Info

This fork was made to tweak the Randomizer in order to make it more suitable for custom challenges specifically for [Arex](https://twitch.tv/Arex). All credit goes to Ajarmar, contributors, and the original randomizer by Dabomstew for all their work.

If you're looking for the ACTUAL randomizer go here: [release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) for changelogs and downloads.


### Installation
Download the randomizer and randomizer settings in order to set it in the New Run Settings in the tracker.

### Compatibility

Will only work with a Triple Bond patch on Pokemon HeartGold.


# Other problems

If you have problems using the randomizer, it could be because of some problem with Java or your operating system. Since the base is still the original UPR by Ajarmar, this link should still generally apply: **[read this page first before creating an issue.](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/About-Java)** **BUT PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER THEM FOR HELP SINCE I'VE MODIFIED THE RANDOMIZER.**
